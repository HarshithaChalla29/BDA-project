**Project tittle: Stock data analysis using news data articles  and sentiments** 

This project is about taking non quantifiable data such as financial news articles about  a company and predicting its future stock trend with news sentiment classification.  Assuming that news articles have impact on stock market, this is an attempt to study  relationship between news and stock trend. To show this, we have created a model  which depict polarity of news articles being positive or negative
